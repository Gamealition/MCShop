Web site for viewing items for sale on a Minecraft server, automatically updates using the plugin SignShopExport

## Example(s)
[MCShop for the Gamealition Minecraft Server](http://laken.pw/mcshop)

## Features
- Automatically updates all shops located on the server every 30 minutes (Thanks to SignShopExport)
- Dynmap support, all coordinates are clickable and will take you to that location on dynmap
- Support for enchanted items
- Shows player heads next to playername (Using Minotaur API)
- Select drop-down box is filterable by typing (Using Select2)
- Sorts results by lowest price (Using Lodash JS Library)
- Results displayed in cards (Materialize CSS Framework)
- Mobile Friendly (Materialize CSS Framework)

## How to set up
1. Install the server plugin [SignShopExport](https://github.com/Gamealition/SignShopExport) by RoyCurtis. This plugin is compatable with SignShop and Quickshop.
2. At the top of `mcshop.js`, edit the values of three variables, `JSONUrl` and `dynmapURL` with your URLs, and then `currencySymbol` with your desired symbol (default is `$`)
3. Upload all files to a web server. (NOTE: If MCShop is located on a different server than the JSON, you may run into some trouble, to fix this, add `Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"` to the .htaccess file in the directory that the JSON is located)
4. If you run into any issues setting up, feel free to open an issue


## To-Do
1. Clean up the code. It's a mess.
2. Work well with SignShop item sets (currently quite buggy)
3. At certain screen widths, some longer item's names go outside of the item's card
